## There is a lot to do

I have started this blog in order to give myself an outlet for creative projects and things I found interesting on the internet. Also something to give me a long format to talk about things. I will mostly be vomiting words onto the page and not proofreading or editing them. So this will be as raw as you'll probably get from me. I hope I can make sense through it all.

I want to explore CG, Web Development, and Game Development/Design here. Currently I am only qualified for Web Development though I have a degree in Computer Animation. There is a lot for me to do and a lot to learn before I can really do any of it.

## My First Render

The heading image here is my first image from trying to learn Architectural Visualization. I watched [How to Make Interiors in Blender (Tutorial) by the Blender Guru](https://youtu.be/wrzSrjAY69c). And like, it looks kinda cool but in reality it is beginners work, and that is what I am at this point. Maybe an advanced beginner. I know a lot of the software but producing production quality results is beyond me.
