## There is a lot to do

I have started this blog in order to give myself an outlet for creative projects and things I found interesting on the internet. Also something to give me a long format to talk about things. I will mostly be vomiting words onto the page and not proofreading or editing them. So this will be as raw as you'll probably get from me. I hope I can make sense through it all.

I want to explore CG, Web Development, and Game Development/Design here. Currently I am only qualified for Web Development though I have a degree in Computer Animation. There is a lot for me to do and a lot to learn before I can really do any of it.

### My First Render

The heading image here is my first image from trying to learn Architectural Visualization. I watched [How to Make Interiors in Blender (Tutorial) by the Blender Guru](https://youtu.be/wrzSrjAY69c). And like, it looks kinda cool but in reality it is beginners work, and that is what I am at this point. Maybe an advanced beginner. I know a lot of the software but, producing production quality results is beyond me. 

I think if I ever get to a point where I can do this for a living it will be important to look back at this and see where I've started. Honestly, If you wanted my true beginnings. You can see my [2008 Demo Reel on YouTube](https://youtu.be/MD23P6i-18Q). It is still probably my best work. Though I have to admit that I did work in the industry for about 9 months doing Archvis. However, I was young and didn't know what I was really doing. I feel like I have a better understanding of it and what quality results look like and I'm excited to get there one day.

### Working on this Website

This website has never been a priority for me and I don't know if it will even now that I have a CMS set up. I am going to give it an honest shot though. I don't like using social media for my thoughts very much. A website has always been my preferred outlet. Character restrictions and having an algorithm randomly show what I said to whomever is unsettling. However, I am enjoying it so far and I think that once I get around learning Hugo a bit better and interfacing with how this theme is set up I'll be more apt to using it. I really just want to make my homepage a page and not my blog posts. Maybe I shouldn't? Who know.

### Did you know I want to write a Novel

And who doesn't?! Right? I have like three ideas in my head and I would like to get them on paper. Even if I only share them with family I think they are cool stories that would be enjoyable to write and read. Maybe one day I'll figure it out and sit down to write them.

### Lets make a video game

My childhood best friend and I have always had the dream of making our own video game and even found a gaming studio. Sadly we both went to Full Sail for Computer Animation and he later got a degree in Computer Science while I depended on my dabbling with websites in the 90s to support me (so far so good!). We hope to one day come back around to getting a game studio going. I am confident I can make the 3d art for it. But I am pretty sure I'm going to need to depend on him to actually program the thing. 

## That's all for now

I think that will be enough for today. I am tired of writing and I have an actual job to attend to so I will get to it. Thanks for reading this far. [Here is the music I was listening to this whole time. ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3jsyANBBy6gOZUSQhiGclx)
