## Happy Halloween!

So for a little while I dabbled in Snapchat Filters, and I think I did a pretty swell job. The University I work at wanted to have graduates able to celebrate using digital swag and I saw Snapchat lenses as a way to explore this so I jumped into it. Little did I know that Lens Studio combined two of my favorite things 3D Art and coding (spoiler: it is all JavaScript). Though, to be told there isn't a lot of coding needed to make lenses.

## TLDR;

There are a lot of tutorials from the SnapChat team with premade scripts that will allow you to do 99% of what you need.
