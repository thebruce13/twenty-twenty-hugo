## Happy Halloween!

So for a little while I dabbled in Snapchat Filters, and I think I did a pretty swell job. The University I work at wanted to have graduates able to celebrate using digital swag and I saw Snapchat lenses as a way to explore this so I jumped into it. Little did I know that Lens Studio combined two of my favorite things 3D Art and coding (spoiler: it is all JavaScript). Though, to be told there isn't a lot of coding needed to make lenses.

## TLDR;

There are a lot of tutorials from the SnapChat team with premade scripts that will allow you to do 99% of what you need.

## What are we going to do here? 

I want to step you through some of the wierd clunkynesses that I needed to overcome in order to make a lens for Snapchat and where I went to solve these problems. I'll be using new assets in this post so we don't need to reuse anything I've used in my job.
