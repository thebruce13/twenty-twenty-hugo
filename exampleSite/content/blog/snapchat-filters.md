## Happy Halloween!

So for a little while I dabbled in Snapchat Filters, and I think I did a pretty swell job. The University I work at wanted to have graduates able to celebrate [using digital swag](https://www.mtu.edu/umc/resources/social-swag/#snapchat) and I saw Snapchat lenses as a way to explore this so I jumped into it. Little did I know that Lens Studio combined two of my favorite things 3D Art and coding (spoiler: it is all JavaScript). Though, to be told there isn't a lot of coding needed to make lenses.

## TLDR;

There are a lot of tutorials from the [Snapchat Guides](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/) with premade scripts that will allow you to do 99% of what you need.

## What are we going to do here?

I want to step you through some of the wierd clunkynesses that I needed to overcome in order to make a lens for Snapchat and where I went to solve these problems. I'll be using new assets in this post so we don't need to reuse anything I've used in my job. I'll be going through setting up Lens Studio, getting your first lens going, making a 3d asset in a free program called Blender. Then we'll add physics to it so we can play with it and move it aroudn.

### What we will not cover.

Using triggers like opening your mouth to start/stop an animation. Unfortnatley I wasn't able to figure that out. Still there is a lot you can do without triggers. We also won't be making any games in Snapchat.  Sorry. 

There is also a lot of "basic" (but super cool) things you can do with Snapchat and if they are related I will link them but I highly suggest you going to the Snapchat Guides and read about them there. Also, picking apart the included projects can shed a lot of light on how to do things.
