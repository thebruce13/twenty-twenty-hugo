So why did I pick "Bruce's Backpack" one reason is because way back in the day on Blogger I started a blog that went nowhere under the same name. It had the same premise. But the reason I started that one is because in high school I had the world's coolest backpack.

It was massive and held all of my stuff. Notepads, textbooks, sketchpads. You name it was put into this bag. The pouches were my favorite because I could load them up with all kinds of goodies. The top side pocket held my [Halo 3 Zune](https://gizmodo.com/first-pics-of-the-zune-halo-3-special-edition-259877) for the longest time. I tell ya, they don't make devices like that anymore.

Look at this awesomeness. It those black patches were to protect the bag from the griptape! I thought it was so ingenious. So naturally through high school I had my bag of essentials and my skateboard with me wherever I went. Funnily enough I never had tools for my skateboard in the backpack. Never thought I'd need them while I was using the thing. 

But the main pocket was so big, I would put my Original Xbox in there, the chords and controllers with a couple games. Haul this with my CRT tv off to a friends house and we're playing Halo till the break of dawn. The good ol days, ya know?

I've since lost this backpack and these images I've lifted off the internet I can't find anymore. So I can't even give a source for them. 

The idea of a backpack for my blog I feel really suits me because you don't know what a person keeps in a backpack, though it has room for a whole heck-of-a-lot. And typically when I reach in to pull something out to show you guys on the web, I'm not sure what I'm grabbing for either. 

I wanted to make this backpack in 3D but proved to beyond my abilities and I went with a basic Northface one for the imagery here but I got to capture the spirit of this bag that served me through high school. I'll revisit it when I get a little more experience under my belt.

Now a days I rock this convertible bag that can either be a traditional backpack or a satchel. I switched to a satchel in college and was so happy the time I opened up the top and reached in for a pen and paper without having to take it off. So this one fits current me very well.
