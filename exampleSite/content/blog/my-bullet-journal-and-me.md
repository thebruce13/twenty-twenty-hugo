So I have had a [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) like notebook from [Moleskin ](https://us.moleskine.com/en/cahier-journal-black/p0411)in my back pocket probably since 2014. I have found that if I don't have the ability to write down things as soon as I hear them I forget them. I am constantly moving on to the next thing and if it isn't in this little book it will never be remembered.

The attraction to it all was that I'd have this little notebook in my back pocket all the time. No app to load, no looking like a jerk when I take out my phone to write a note. I can write and know exactly where the notes are at all times. The drawback is it was a very limited space
