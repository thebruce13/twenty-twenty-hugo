\[Get image of all notebooks, or at least a few.\]

So I have had a [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) like notebook from [Moleskin ](https://us.moleskine.com/en/cahier-journal-black/p0411)in my back pocket probably since 2014. I have found that if I don't have the ability to write down things as soon as I hear them I forget them. I am constantly moving on to the next thing and if it isn't in this little book it will never be remembered.

The attraction to it all was that I'd have this little notebook in my back pocket all the times. Which I thought had loads of benefits.

* No app to load.
* Can draw if needed without having to change modes.
* Tear off a sheet and give it to someone.
* No looking like a jerk when I take out my phone to write a note.
* I can write and know exactly where to look for it.

This can be weighed with the cons and counter points such as

* Easily lost
* Can't email a piece of paper. could just message/text them
* Doesn't work in the dark
* No online backup

Still I was committed to using this format to get quick notes out and hopefully keep my life just a little more organized.
