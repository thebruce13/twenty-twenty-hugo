## Welcome

Looks like you caught me sleeping

There that is better, gotta make sure you've got your mask on when you go outside. Honestly I think masks are great and they show you a bit of personality that you don't get out of regular clothes.

But here is my awake face. Anyway.

## Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm a bit odd, maybe. That's a lie, I'm as normal as they come. But really I want to welcome you to whatever this page becomes. I have a lot of interests and passions with a career in Web Development.

You might be curious why I went with a theme for my website instead of "making it from scratch" because time and energy are things I don't want to expend troubleshooting bugs. And to be honest I think the 2020 Wordpress theme is pretty dope. You can give me some internet points because this is actually a [Hugo Theme]().

I also am a 3d artists, that you can see more about on my Projects page. I am 100% ready to talk about the finer points in 3d films.

Right now it is a hobby (that I have a Bachelor Degree from [Full Sail](https://www.fullsail.edu/) in) but I would be thrilled to turn it into a side hustle.

Thinking of side hustles though, I also sell T-shirts on [Tee-public](https://www.teepublic.com/user/thebruce13) and Redbubble some of the ideas are silly and niche but I'm happy if it supports my WoW subscription.
